In order to formulate a good question we would kindly ask from you the following:
- [ ] A good meaningful title so the question is easily understood
- [ ] Give us context. If there's a problem why do you think it's a problem.
- [ ] Feel free to share your possible outcomes. Often when we transmit how we would see a solution, we give the person a better understanding of our question.
