# Kaviar Development Playground

To read the documentation visit [KaviarJS Official Documentation](https://www.kaviarjs.com/docs/).

Hello there fellow developer! This GitHub package is mainly used to quickly bootstrap Kaviar and start working on the core components or Kaviar's official bundles.

It is also the place where all the stars need to be collected to show-case its popularity. So if you enjoy this work please show your support by starring this package. If not, let us know what can we do to deserve it, [our feedback form is here](https://forms.gle/DTMg5Urgqey9QqLFA)
